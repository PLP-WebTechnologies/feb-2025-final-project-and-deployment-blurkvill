        <p>I made this website project to pay homage to one of the best anime websites to ever exist.</p>
        <p>The website was initially known as 9anime. It was founded in 2016 and in 2023 rebranded itself to AniWave. It had several domains, most recently it used a .to domain associated with the Kingdom of Tonga.</p>

        <p>The site has been targeted by copyright enforcement organizations such as Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment several times, including in 2022 and in 2023.</p>

        <p>On the 27th of August 2024, the service was shut down, together with several related websites. Most of the sites features, such as searching, streaming, and downloading were unavailable, but users were still able to export bookmarks for a brief period of time, before the site fully went offline. The website, along with many related television/movie piracy websites related to it, shortly had a goodbye message displayed, with the music video of Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's "See You Again" located at the bottom of it. It reflected on the history of the website, and encouraged users to switch to legal services to support creators. On 29 August 2024, Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment confirmed that they had assisted the Vietnamese police in shutting down the site and many other connected sites including FMovies.</p>
